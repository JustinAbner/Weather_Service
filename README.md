# Weather Service API

## Synopsis
This project revolves around a weather API and user input. Users are prompted to choose if they wish to enter either a zipcode or city/state of the area they wish and the respective coordinates are retrieved. An API request with the coordinates and an API key are used to obtain the temperature (the current, high, and low of the day), the pressure, humidity, cloud cover status, and the overall weather description.
